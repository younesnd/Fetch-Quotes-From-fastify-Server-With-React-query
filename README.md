# Fetch-Quotes-From-fastify-Server-With-React-query 


In this Small project we will use API Layer and React-Query to : 

  1- fetch a list of top quotes using the useQuery hook .
  
  2- Create a new quote using the useMutation hook and automatically re-fetch the list of top quotes .
  
  In order to do this we used a small [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/)  app ,it has a few API endpoints that will
allow us to retrieve and update data , Note that the server, by default, is running on localhost:4000
